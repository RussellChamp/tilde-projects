This is just some stuff I've worked on as a member of tilde.town
When the site ever goes away (and I know it will someday), I'll at least have a copy of all my silly, mostly-pointless projects.

TODO:
* 'musicBot' that will post when a new musicforprogramming.net track is available
* add an 'idle' or 'advertise' channel for bots where they only respond to !rollcall and a 'working' channel where they fully work (eg so madlibbot can advertise itself in #tildetown but will only 'work' in #madlibs)
