How do do stuff

Data structure
users["name"]
 .talked = array of irc times
 .mentioned = array of irc times


DATA DAEMON
* Parse log for nicks that said something
 - Populate data structure
* For each line, log the person who talked
 - Check if any other person was mentioned
 - Only log if it is at least 1 minute past their last chat/reference (maybe
   to reduce data size)
* Write to log file
 - Same file or dated one?
 - Only certain time frames??
* Run daily/hourly?

PRESENTATION
* Select a user name from the drop down
 - See a timeline with colored strands of when they spoke and were mentioned
* Something that looks like the Github commit history
* Use D3 for coolness

TODO
* Add a "sort by" dropdown
 - name
 - most active
