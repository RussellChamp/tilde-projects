1421323301	karlen	ive spent the last 15mins looking for nowertb with banter but only one came up and its not bantz
1421323368	jumblesale	banter
1421323895	karlen	ok there will be a nowertb with banter in it at somepoint but its not bantz
1421323963	jumblesale	how can you have banter and it not be legendary bantz?
1421324052	karlen	It's comforting to realize that no one will ever read this.I am a quiet person for the most part. I mean, I talk, but most of the time it's preprogrammed banter just to pass time and please the people around me.
1421324515	karlen	banter all over the world
1421325936	karlen	haha there is a podcast they ahve called the Bantams banter I have heard mention of before
1421326023	karlen	heard lots of Bantam banter when they beat Arsenal a season or two back
1421326312	karlen	haha course, they bantered me off but such is life for a top drawer banter merchant such as myself
1421326892	karlen	so that guy is called Carl Jenkison and he plays for Arsenal and hes a right top lad and every other word he says is literally banter
1421326918	karlen	of banterbury
1421327028	karlen	he's just a banter lad
1421327036	jumblesale	karlen nobody's THAT banter
1421327168	karlen	me too, will get something banter for lunch
1421328693	jumblesale	how banter was your lunch? top drawer or legendary?
1421329045	jumblesale	just putting together a little faw for banter
1421329247	karlen	1) What is banter 2) How to banter 3) How to banter someone off 4) Top bantz 5) Banter phrases
1421329333	karlen	6) Lad banter 7) Am I banter? 8) Banter resources 9) Examples of banter 10) When to banter
1421329371	karlen	i'll put a banter file in my ~ and try to address some of these issues
1421330214	jumblesale	karlen your banter contribution is legendary, I'll combine the two
1421330680	karlen	ill try and think of some more once my banter juices have recharged
1421331867	jumblesale	my dream is to travel anywhere in the world and immediately be able to banter off the first #lad I see
1421332132	karlen	love your top banter phrases jumblesale
1421332270	jumblesale	I love everything about your banter file karlen
1421332374	karlen	feels wrong typing in less banter
1421332494	jumblesale	banter
1421332676	jumblesale	I go home. it's dark. I find a pen and hastily scrawl a note. "~wife. sorry. I can't be with you any more. I need banter. #legend". charles barks. he does not recognise me. I am a different man to the one who left this morning. I put the note on the table, collect my passport and step out into the night. somewhere out there a lad needs to be bantered off. and I am the only one who can do it.
1421332760	jumblesale	we were just enjoying some banter.
1421337186	jumblesale	nah mate just kidding it was shit #banter
1421337361	karlen	i got bantered right off there

1421402804	jumblesale	banter = comedy
1421402887	karlen	you removed my top banter pun, it was the one bit of bantz in that file worth while
1421402953	karlen	from "turn your banter from piss poor to top drawer"
1421402982	karlen	or something like that, I had to delete the file from my ~. I had exceeded my banter allowance according the du -BANTS
1421403014	karlen	or quota -u -BANTER rather
1421403230	jumblesale	http://tilde.town/~banter/
1421403809	karlen	wow, maybe they are the banter messiah?!

1421678914	karlen	Mate Crustaceans ain't shit. Wait till you banter off a Banatee
1421679040	jumblesale	banatee might be a new low in banter punning
1421771342	karlen	you are ascending the banter charts that is for sure
1421771528	karlen	Mate, only in Ireland is that Banter
1421771917	karlen	look what we did to this other guy! he didn't even get exposed! LabMateBanter http://cdn6.bigcommerce.com/s-vhn7zwb/products/452/images/411/eos_safe_showers_freeze__77418__05399.1405105554.1280.1280.jpg?c=2
1421773775	krowbar	i'm thinking of writing a banterbot for scoring #banter
1421773807	krowbar	but i'll first need a corpus of #banter
1421773838	karlen	mensch -q banter
1421773857	karlen	or mensch -q "#banter"
