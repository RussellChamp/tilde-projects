Here are some of my thoughts on our Twine story guidelines

## The Player ##
* Should have global objects for $items, $events, $stats, and $skills that any
  story could modify

## Player Inventory ##
* Global inventory items should be of the form
* Per-story inventory items should be of the form
* To pick up an item, use the <<action "Get {item}">>
* To check if a player has already retrieved an item, either check the
* $items['NAME'] value or check "visited("Get NAME")"
* An item can be added to the global items hash with the following
  $items['NAME'] = VALUE
* A unique item, like "gearbox" or "sword", will have VALUE of true
* When a unique items is used up or destroyed, set its value to false
* Generic items that the player can have many of, like "gold" or "smallKey",
  will have a numerical value

## Player Stats and Skills ##
* Are persistant between stories
* Are stored as
  $stat.{name} = {value}
  $skill.{name} = {value}

## The Hub ##
* Should heal the player
* Should be able to tell the player their stats/skills

## Rules for all stories ##
* All stories should have a path that leads back to the hub
* Stories can NOT kill the player
** Alternately, we could allow player death to 'port them to the Hub
* Stories should not cause the player to lose or use up global objects
** An exception to this could be gold or money
* Should not decrease a stat or skill
